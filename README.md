This thing is supposed to listen for UDP Gelf messages, store them in memory in a bounded collection and show them in a semblance of graylog web interface.

For use as graylog fake/somewhat centralized logging in development. Might be useful with docker.

#### development

```
$ nvm use
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:8080
